Project Title: LSTM Forecast - Time Series Forecasting using Long Short-Term Memory Networks

Project Overview:

LSTM Forecast is a deep learning-based system that utilizes Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to predict future values in a time series data. The system is designed to handle complex time series data with non-linear relationships and seasonality.

Methodology:

1. Data Collection: Gather time series data (e.g., historical sales, weather patterns)
2. Data Preprocessing: Clean, preprocess, and normalize data for modeling
3. Model Development: Train an LSTM network using techniques like:
    - Univariate or multivariate time series forecasting
    - Single or multi-step forecasting
    - Hyperparameter tuning for optimal performance
4. Model Evaluation: Validate model performance using metrics like mean absolute error (MAE), mean squared error (MSE), and root mean squared percentage error (RMSPE)
5. Forecasting: Generate forecasts for future time periods

Key Features:

1. Accurate Forecasts: Provide accurate and reliable forecasts for time series data
2. Handling Non-Linearity: Effectively handle non-linear relationships in time series data
3. Seasonality: Capture seasonality and trends in time series data
4. Real-time Forecasting: Generate forecasts in real-time for timely decision-making
